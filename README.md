# Project 1 - *Flicks*

**Flicks** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [X] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [X] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [X] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [X] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [X] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [ ] User can search for a movie.
- [X] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [ ] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. What are protocols and how do they work?
2. Animation

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

At first I felt unsatisfied from copying huge chunks of code but as I implemented more and more things with less direct help, I figured out what each line was doing. I wish I had an overview or diagram of how each element was related to each other. I think a general discussion on what are protocols or an exercise creating one would help other people understand it better too.
